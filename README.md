# parrot.live

An initiative, using frames from [`terminal-parrot`](https://github.com/jmhobbs/terminal-parrot), to allow any computer with `curl` to display detective_pikachu_partying_with_other_pokemon.

# Try it!
```bash
curl parrot.live
```

# :partyparrot:
<div align="center">

</div>

# Thanks
