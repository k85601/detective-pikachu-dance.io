detective pikachu doing his job

An initiative, using frames from [`terminal-parrot`](https://github.com/k85601/detective-pikachu-dance), to allow any computer with `curl` to display detective_pikachu_partying_with_other_pokemon.

# Try it!
```bash
curl https://github.com/k85601/detective-pikachu-dance.io
```
